	What Is A Gold Award?
</h4>
<p>
	Since 1916, Girl Scoutâ€™s highest award has stood for excellence and leadership for girls everywhere. 
Soon, you will be joining the ranks of generations of young women who have made a difference in their 
communities and beyond. 
 
As a Girl Scout, you are part of the sisterhood of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, a 
global movement comprised of more than ten million girls worldwide who are using their talents to 
positively impact their communities. With your talent and passion, you, too, can make changes in your 
community that can reach people around the world. 
 
The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest and most prestigious award that a Girl Scout Senior or 
Ambassador may earn. Fulfilling the requirements for the Girl Scout Gold Award starts with completing 
two Girl Scout Senior or Ambassador journeys or having earned the Silver Award and completing one 
Senior or Ambassador journey. Each journey you complete gives you the skills you need to plan and 
implement your Take Action Project. 
 
After you have fulfilled the journey(s) requirement, 80 hours is the suggested minimum hours for the 
steps: identifying an issue, investigating it thoroughly, getting help and building a team, creating a plan, 
presenting your plan, gathering feedback, taking action, and education and inspiring other. The 
suggested minimum hours are not a rule; they are a guide for you to plan your time in achieving your 
goal.
